Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: While VGG and ResNet classified it correctly, AlexNet classified it as "bull mastiff"


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG model classified dog_02 as "vase", ResNet classified it as "pug,pugdog", AlexNet classified it as "pug,pugdog", as a result none of them knew but the pugdog really looks like a bulldog


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three classification algorithms were correct


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I will choose ResNet because in the first question, the most important question, AlexNet guessed the dog breed wrong, and in the second question, the VGG algorithm called the dog photo "VASE"! Finally, in the third question, ResNet had almost no offside since he got it right in all three algorithms, so I will say ResNet is the best.
